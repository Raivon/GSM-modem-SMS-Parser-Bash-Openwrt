# GSM-modem-SMS-Parser-Bash-Openwrt
After searching for lot of forums for parsing incoming SMS from GSM modems, i ran out of options as no forum mentions how to parse the incoming SMS from GSM modems, I finally had a chance and was successful at parsing the incoming messages in proper format. Anyone who has trouble parsing the messages will find this tutorial helpful. Adding on, i have developed some functions for GSM modem for sending SMS, reading and Parsing SMS, Deleting, getting signal info, and sim card status. All are written in Bash shell scripting on Openwrt and tested with 3 modems i got a chance to work with : QUECTEL: EC-25E, HUAWEI: ME909s-821 and SIMCOM: SIM7100E.

To get them to work, make sure you have comgt utility installed on your linux. If not, you can install it by sudo apt-get install comgt.
